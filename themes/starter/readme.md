This is the repository for the CWP "starter" theme. This theme is a highly accessible Bootstrap 4 theme which you can use as a starter for your CWP project.

The [WƒÅtea theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-watea-theme) can be installed on top of the [Starter theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-starter-theme) (see [cascading themes](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/templates/themes)) to provide a more visually appealing start to a CWP website.
