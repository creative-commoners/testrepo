# Becoming a maintainer

If you are someone who has a history of good contributing to Fluent (or really any module
in the tractorcow vendor), we'd probably love to have you as a maintainer. This would give
you write access, the ability to review the work of others' in the community, and get more of
a say in the general development of the module.

If you meet the following criteria and would like to apply, feel free to either [contact me directly](https://github.com/tractorcow)
or leave an issue requesting access:

 - Have contributed to Fluent in the past (not necessarily via code)
 - Show quality of work / character (or mix thereof)
 - Have been around long enough to make yourself familiar
