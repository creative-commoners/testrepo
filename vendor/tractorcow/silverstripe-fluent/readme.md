## Simple Silverstripe Localisation

This module allows websites to manage localisation of content, and navigation between localisations,
in a similar fashion to [Translatable](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable)
or [Multilingual](https://github.com/kreationsbyran/multilingual).

Locales are distinguished by a url prefix, that of the selected locale, at the start
of all page links. E.g. `http://damian.geek.nz/en_NZ/about-me` would be the NZ English
version of a page. This could be localised into Maori at `http://damian.geek.nz/mi_NZ/about-me`

Fluent also integrates nicely with Google Sitemaps module, linking localisations for each page as per
[Google's internationalisation guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182192?hl=en&ref_topic=2370587)

Fluent also supports the use of multiple domains to assist in locale filtering
(e.g. a .com for English, and a .cn for Chinese).

Back end control is provided by a simple CMS filter.
