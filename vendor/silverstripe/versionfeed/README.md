## Overview

The module creates an RSS feed on each page with their change history, as well as one for the entire site.

## Requirements

 * SilverStripe ^4

**Note:** For a SilverStripe 3.x compatible version, please use [the 1.x release line](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-versionfeed/tree/1.2).

## Installation

Install with composer by running `composer require silverstripe/versionfeed` in the root of your SilverStripe project.

## Usage

For usage instructions see [user manual](docs/en/userguide/index.md).

## Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface, transifex.com. Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please use [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-versionfeed](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-versionfeed) to contribute translations, rather than sending pull requests with YAML files.
