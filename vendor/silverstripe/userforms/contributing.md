# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Create an issue, explaining a bug or proposal. Submit pull requests if you feel brave. Speak to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/assertchris).

## Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a third party translation interface, transifex.com. Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation, and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please use [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-userforms](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-userforms) to contribute translations, rather than sending pull requests with YAML files.
